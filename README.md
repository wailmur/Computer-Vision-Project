Important Things to Note:

1. Current code only works with one face and one hand. 
2. Besides open cv2, another module known as cvzone needs to be installed. Install with pip3 install cvzone, documentation found here: https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone/blob/master/README.md
3. Hats can merge and cannot be unmerged, just restart the program.
4. All the hats should be in the same folder as the python file.
5. Demonstration video included in folder.
6. Hats are unrendered when no facial mesh is detected.
7. Download all the Hat.png files for the filter to work.
